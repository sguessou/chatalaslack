# Chat à la Slack

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sguessou/chatalaslack/master/chat_1.PNG)


A simple web chat application built with Clojure(Script).   
This small application doesn't include all of the features expected in a real web chat application, but simply demonstrates the use of websockets for real time messaging in a Clojure(Script) environment.

There are 3 predefined rooms where the users can have a group chat. Users can privately message eachothers as well.

For a live version go here --> [Chat à la Slack](https://chatalaslack.herokuapp.com/)
